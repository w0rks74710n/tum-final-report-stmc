\chapter{Final Remarks and Overall Experience}\label{chapter:conclusion}
During the course we learnt about the importance of demand calibration and the challenges faced while doing so. It is clear to me now the main difference between FDSA and SPSA and in which situations it is suitable to use them. I personally learnt a lot of new concepts (as I do not possess a Transportation Engineering background), not only from a theoretical point of view but also from an applied perspective. I find the concepts thought throughout the course to be highly valuable and some of them applicable not only in the context of demand calibration and I would also be interested in keep contributing to the development of the project presented during the lecture.
